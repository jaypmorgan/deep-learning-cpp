# Deep Learning in C++ (with libtorch)

This repository contains an archivable collection of Deep Learning
scripts written in C++, using the
(libtorch)[https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/installing.html] framework.

These scripts are just more a curiosity and wanting to understand
how writing Deep Learning projects in C++ would be. These examples
will, on occasion, use C++ a bit too much that I would normally use
it. For example, to download a file and extract it to some location,
I would probably just use GNU-based command line tools, not C++.

Nevertheless, you're welcome to cut, copy, or paste your own examples.

These examples use:
- libtorch 2.1.0
- C++20
- Xmake
